  overview: "121nexus deploys cloud-based track & trace solutions for biomedical manufacturers.
    A recent report prepared by McKinsey & Co estimates that the cost of medical errors
    introduced by inadequate track & trace on medical devices is estimated to be between
    $18 and $115 billion annually. In response to the need in the industry for such
    a track & trace solution, 121nexus developed MDDTrack™, which is a cloud-based
    software solution for manufacturers to enhance recall management and post-market
    surveillance in the medical devices and diagnostics industry.\r\n\r\n121nexus'
    technology solves a problem so critical to public health that it was awarded a
    National Science Foundation grant to accelerate commercialization of this unique
    approach to biomedical track & trace. The core technology has been claimed in
    US Patent 8,533,075 and pending US Patent application 13/792,651. Other domestic
    and international patents are pending."

  overview: "Founded in 1996, Traction® Software, Inc. set out to eliminate the frustrating
    and costly inefficiencies in team communications and information management by
    creating a revolutionary web-based hypertext Journal. Traction TeamPage was first
    released in 1999 and, after commercial launch in July 2002, became the first blog
    and wiki product for enterprise use. TeamPage is used worldwide by major pharma,
    finance, manufacturing, healthcare and other enterprises, universities, and branches
    of the U.S. Government.\r\n\r\nTraction draws heavily on pioneering techniques
    and visions from the work of Doug Engelbart, Ted Nelson, Andy van Dam, and Vannevar
    Bush. The Traction Journal was directly inspired by Doug Engelbart's 1992 paper
    Toward High-Performance Organizations: A Strategic Role for Groupware and Vannevar
    Bush's Memex concept from his 1945 Atlantic Monthly article, As We May Think.
    Engelbart's hypertext Journal (part of NLS for oN Line System) first demonstrated
    in 1968 served as a model and starting point for Traction TeamPage development."
